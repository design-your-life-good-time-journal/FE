Research


	Market research - best app features:  Source:   https://zapier.com/blog/best-journaling-apps/

The best apps to keep a journal have a few things in common:
Easy entry: If it takes more than a couple of clicks or taps to add a journal entry, chances are you're not going to do it.
Pleasant interface: A minimalist, uncluttered interface helps you focus on your thoughts and make journaling a pleasant experience.
Reminders: Perhaps the biggest challenge to journaling is remembering to do it. Automatic reminders help you keep up the habit.
Exporting: Just in case the app stops being developed or you want to move to a different journaling platform, you'll want to be able to export your entries in a format other programs can read, such as PDF or RTF.
Syncing: Syncing will make sure your journal's up to date no matter what device you're using.
Other features that might be important to you include password protection, Markdown support, ability to add more than one photo, automatically adding location and weather, and journaling prompts.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
